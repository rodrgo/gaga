Some challenges in implementing this code:

+ TOL is fed into GAGA for the algorithm's stopping condition (on the norm of the residual)
	A different TOL must be used to check success $\|x - xhat\|/\|x\|$

+ To check success we check that $\|x - xhat\|_1$ is not too far away from $\|\eta\|_1$ 

+ $\|eta\|_1 = \sum_i |\eta_i|$ and since $\eta_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, then 
$|\eta_i|$ is distributed as a half-normal.

E[|\eta_i|] = \sigma*\sqrt{2/\pi}
Var[|\eta_i|] = \sigma^2*(1 - 2/\pi)

+ Our stopping condition is abs(res_norm - res_norm_mean) > TOL*res_norm_sd
	so TOL measures how many standard deviations from the mean we are aiming to have

+ createProblem_smv_noise first generated
	y = A*x
	and then adds a noise vector $\eta$ that is scaled such that $\|\eta\| = \sigma*\|y\|$.
